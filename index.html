                            effort by many
                            developers on
                            many digital projects. Over two decades in, I am indeed a consumer of digital content.

                            As memory serves, I recall
                            that day
                            many years ago when I went home for the first time wearing a contraption comprised of steel
                            clamps fitted around my molars which a steel apparatus could slide into on each side: one
                            part
                            of it housed in my mouth while the other portruded out around my cheeks and connected to a
                            strap with adjustable resistance which went around my neck. They called it a neckbrace and
                            it
                            was part of my ortho prework to help fix my overbite, still I knew it as the bane of my 5th
                            grade as far as perceptions went.
                            The
                            nagging
                            pain and the bars which actually were a bit too long at first causing it to tear into the
                            back
                            of my mouth was a thing.

                            As it turns out, during that same time I also received a handme down NES with some video
                            games
                            and
                            decided to
                            try it out. All of a sudden the pain became much lighter and I noticed my focus shifted
                            away
                            from
                            the
                            brace and onto what was happening right in front of me.

                            I was
                            told it would change, but it looks like throughout all the years I was the one who turned
                            out
                            to be
                            the
                            constant :).
